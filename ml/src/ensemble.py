"""
TremorTrace ML Pipeline — Ensemble

2-model weighted ensemble that combines Spiral CNN and Wave CNN predictions
into a single probability percentage (0–100%) with risk tier classification.

SELF-CONTAINED: This file uses only standard library imports and will be
copied directly into the backend. No TensorFlow, no relative imports.

Output is ALWAYS a percentage with a risk tier — never a binary label.
Both input modes (drawn / uploaded) are processed identically; the
input_mode field is metadata only.

def get_risk_tier(probability_percent):

    Determines the risk tier for a given PD probability percentage.

    Risk tiers provide a human-readable interpretation of the raw probability:
        0–25%   → Low Risk (green)
        25–45%  → Mild Risk (yellow)
        45–65%  → Moderate Risk (orange)

    A score near 0 means the model is uncertain (prediction near 50%),
